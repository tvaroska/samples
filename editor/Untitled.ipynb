This electronic game rating system is not working because it is self-regulated and the fines for violating the rating system are nominal. As a result an independent body should oversee the game industry and companies that knowingly violate the rating system should be prohibited from releasing a game for two years.”\n",

    "The author concludes that electronic game rating system is not working compared to the movie rating system. He gives reasoning for the argument by stating that electronic companies ability to self manage and regulate the rating system is part of the problem. Author also gives reason for what needs to be done in order for electronic rating system to work, but his reasons are weak. In the next few paragraphs, I will explain why the author’s reasons are weak and what could strengthen the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the author mentions that by hiring an independent company to oversee the operation of the electronic rating system would solve the issue. This big assumption that author makes here is that he assumes independent company would do a better job in rating games than electronic game companies themselves. If the electronic gaming companies had a better understanding on how to improve, they might themselves do a better job than independent company to oversee the ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the author mentions that if an electronic company violates the rating system rule, then the penalty would be to prohibit that company from releasing any games for two years. This is another weak point the makes to support his argument because if the electronic company regular product-life cycle is to release each gave every two years, this penalty wouldn’t hurt the company at all. Also, there is not way of assessing how many year of prohibition would be adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Author could have strengthen his argument, if he provided some data point such as from the movie industry to defend this stance that making independent company oversee and prohibition of movie release actually worked in the long-run. Perhaps, some research data that showed making these changes would actually work, would benefit the author’s overall argument stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the author’s argument that electronic game rating system is not working is weak. Both of the points he made regarding independent company oversee and violation penalty are weak without data showing that it might work.\n",

       "      text: \"## Essay Grade and Feedback\\n\\n**Score:** 3\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThis essay demonstrates some competence but is clearly flawed in several areas. While it identifies weaknesses in the original argument, it doesn\\'t fully articulate them and fails to provide compelling counter-arguments or suggestions for improvement.\\n\\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\\n\\n* **Quality of Ideas (3):** The essay identifies the core weaknesses of the original argument – the assumption that an independent body would be better and the potentially ineffective nature of the proposed penalty. However, it doesn\\'t delve deeply into *why* these points are weak.  It mentions the game companies potentially having a better understanding of how to improve their rating system, but doesn\\'t elaborate on this crucial point.  Similarly, it mentions the game release cycle, but doesn\\'t connect it strongly enough to the ineffectiveness of the proposed penalty. The suggestion to use data from the movie industry is relevant, but the essay doesn\\'t explore *what kind* of data would be useful or how it might apply to the gaming context.\\n\\n* **Organization (3):** The essay follows a basic structure, addressing each point in a separate paragraph. However, the transitions between paragraphs are weak, and the overall flow feels choppy.  The conclusion simply restates the introduction without adding any new insights.\\n\\n* **Writing Style (3):** The essay suffers from a lack of sentence variety and imprecise word choice. Phrases like \\\"This is another weak point the makes\\\" are grammatically incorrect and detract from the clarity of the argument.  The language is generally simplistic and lacks sophistication.\\n\\n* **Grammar & Usage (3):** While not riddled with errors, the essay contains several grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasings.  The sentence structure is often repetitive, and there are instances of incorrect pronoun usage and subject-verb agreement. The repeated use of \\\"weak\\\" also contributes to a sense of stylistic monotony.\\n\\n* **Summary:**  The essay provides a basic critique of the original argument but lacks depth and precision. The analysis is superficial, and the suggestions for improvement are underdeveloped.  The writing style is basic and contains grammatical errors that detract from the overall effectiveness of the essay.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\\n\\n* **Develop ideas more fully:** Instead of just stating that the original argument\\'s points are weak, explain *why* they are weak and provide specific examples to illustrate your points. For example, explore different scenarios where an independent body might not be better equipped to rate games.  Discuss the varying development cycles for different types of games and how a two-year ban might disproportionately affect certain companies.\\n* **Strengthen organization and transitions:** Use clearer topic sentences and transition phrases to connect your ideas and improve the flow of the essay.  Provide a more insightful conclusion that summarizes your main points and offers a final perspective on the original argument.\\n* **Improve writing style:**  Vary your sentence structure and word choice. Replace vague language with more precise and descriptive terms.  Focus on creating a clear, concise, and engaging style.\\n* **Proofread carefully:** Pay close attention to grammar, mechanics, and usage. Eliminate errors in sentence structure, pronoun usage, and subject-verb agreement.\\n\\n\\nBy addressing these weaknesses, the student can significantly improve the quality and persuasiveness of their writing.\\n\"\n",
